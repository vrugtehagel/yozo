// TEST: Complex flow pipelines work properly
// Given a generic flow is created
// and a complex flow pipeline gets set up
// When the flow is triggered with value 100
// Then the total amount is 100
// When 100 milliseconds elapse
// and the flow is triggered with value 1
// and the flow is triggered with value 1
// Then the total amount is 102
// Verify the end has not been reached
// When 150 milliseconds elapse
// Then the end has been reached once
// When the flow is triggered with value 10
// Then the total amount is 102

// TEST: Flows get taken down after re-running an effect
// Given a live variable gets set up with array and activeIndex
// and an effect is set up listening for changes at the active index
// and the effect gets time to run
// When the item at index 0 changes to 'qux'
// Then there were 1 changes
// When the item at index 1 changes to 'quux'
// and the active index gets set to 1
// and the effect gets time to run
// and the item at index 0 changes to 'foo again'
// Then there were 1 changes
// When the item at index 1 changes to 'bar again'
// Then there were 2 changes
